; Top level file for reading and recording .cpu file contents.
; Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2006 Red Hat, Inc.
; This file is part of CGEN.
; See file COPYING.CGEN for details.

; This file [and its subordinates] contain no C code (well, as little as
; possible).  That lives at a layer above us.

; A .cpu file consists of several sections:
;
; - basic definitions (e.g. cpu variants, word size, endianness, etc.)
; - enums (enums are used throughout so by convention there is a special
;   section in which they're defined)
; - attributes
; - instruction fields and formats
; - hardware descriptions (e.g. registers, allowable immediate values)
; - model descriptions (e.g. pipelines, latencies, etc.)
; - instruction operands (mapping of insn fields to associated hardware)
; - instruction definitions
; - macro instruction definitions

; TODO:
; - memory access, layout, etc.
; - floating point quirks
; - ability to describe an ABI
; - anything else that comes along

; Notes:
; - by convention most objects are subclasses of <ident> (having name, comment,
;   and attrs elements and they are the first three elements of any .cpu file
;   entry

; Guidelines:
; - Try to conform to R5RS, try to limit guile-ness.
;   The current code is undoubtedly off in many places.

; Conventions:
; [I want there to be a plethora of conventions and I want them strictly
; adhered to.  ??? There's probably a few violations here and there.
; No big deal - fix them!]
; These conventions are subject to revision.
;
; - procs/vars local to a file are named "-foo"
; - only routines that emit application code begin with "gen-"
; - symbols beginning with "c-" are either variables containing C code
;   or procedures that generate C code, similarily for C++ and "c++-"
; - variables containing C code begin with "c-"
; - only routines that emit an entire file begin with "cgen-"
; - all .cpu file elements shall have -foo-parse and -foo-read procedures
; - global vars containing class definitions shall be named "<class-name>"
; - procs related to a particular class shall be named "class-name-proc-name",
;   class-name may be abbreviated
; - procs that test whether something is an object of a particular class
;   shall be named "class-name?"
; - in keeping with Scheme conventions, predicates shall have a "?" suffix
; - in keeping with Scheme conventions, methods and procedures that modify an
;   argument or have other side effects shall have a "!" suffix,
;   usually these procs return "*UNSPECIFIED*"
; - all -foo-parse,parse-foo procs shall have `context' as the first arg
;   [FIXME: not all such procs have been converted]
; - stay away from non-portable C symbols.
