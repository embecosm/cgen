;;; included anyway.

;;; This is copied from the tracing support in debug.scm.
;;; If merged into the main distribution it will need an efficiency
;;; and layout cleanup pass.

; FIXME: Prefix "proc-" added to not collide with cgen stuff.

; Put this stuff in the debug module since we need the trace facilities.
