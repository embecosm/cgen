; Instruction formats are computed after the .cpu file has been read in.
; ??? May also wish to allow programmer to specify formats, but not sure this
; will complicate things more than it simplifies them, so it's defered.
;
; Two kinds of formats are defined here: iformat and sformat.
; (pronounced "I-format" and "S-format")
;
; Iformats are the instruction format as specified by the instructions' fields,
; and are the machine computed version of the generally known notion of an
; "instruction format".  No semantic information is attributed to iformats.
;
; Sformats are the same as iformats except that semantics are used to
; distinguish them.  For example, if an operand is refered to in one mode by
; one instruction and in a different mode by another instruction, then these
; two insns would have different sformats but the same iformat.  Sformats
; are used in simulator extraction code to collapse the number of cases that
; must be handled.  They can also be used to collapse the number of cases
; in the modeling code.
;
; The "base length" is the length of the insn that is initially fetched for
; decoding purposes.
; Formats are fixed in length.  For variable instruction length architectures
; there are separate formats for each insn's possible length.
