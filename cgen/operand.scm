; The `hw-index' class.
; [Was named `index' but that conflicts with the C library function and caused
; problems when using Hobbit.  And `index' is too generic a name anyway.]
;
; An operand combines a hardware object with its index.
; e.g. in an array of registers an operand serves to combine the register bank
; with the instruction field that chooses which one.
; Hardware elements are accessed via other means as well besides instruction
; fields so we need a way to designate something as being an index.
; The `hw-index' class does that.  It serves as a facade to the underlying
; details.
; ??? Not sure whether this is the best way to handle this or not.
;
; NAME is the name of the index or 'anonymous.
; This is used, for example, to give a name to the simulator extraction
; structure member.
; TYPE is a symbol that indicates what VALUE is.
; scalar: the hardware object is a scalar, no index is required
;         [MODE and VALUE are #f to denote "undefined" in this case]
; constant: a (non-negative) integer
; str-expr: a C expression as a string
; rtx: an rtx to be expanded
; ifield: an ifield object
; operand: an operand object
; ??? A useful simplification may be to always record the value as an rtx
; [which may require extensions to rtl so is deferred].
; ??? We could use runtime type identification, but doing things this way
; adds more structure.

; Derived operands.
;
; Derived operands are used to implement operands more complex than just
; the mapping of an instruction field to a register bank.  Their present
; raison d'etre is to create a new axis on which to implement the complex
; addressing modes of the i386 and m68k.  The brute force way of describing
; these instruction sets would be to have one `dni' per addressing mode
; per instruction.  What's needed is to abstract away the various addressing
; modes within something like operands.
;
; ??? While internally we end up with the "brute force" approach, in and of
; itself that's ok because it's an internal implementation issue.
; See <multi-insn>.
;
; ??? Another way to go is to have one dni per addressing mode.  That seems
; less clean though as one dni would be any of add, sub, and, or, xor, etc.
;
; ??? Some addressing modes have side-effects (e.g. pre-dec, etc. like insns).
; This can be represented, but if two operands have side-effects special
; trickery may be required to get the order of side-effects right.  Need to
; avoid any "trickery" at all.
;
; ??? Not yet handled are modelling parameters.
; ??? Not yet handled are the handlers,getter,setter spec of normal operands.
;
; ??? Division of class members b/w <operand> and <derived-operand> is wip.
; ??? As is potential introduction of other classes to properly organize
; things.
