		; NON-MODE-C-TYPE is the C type to use in situations where
		; modes aren't available.  A somewhat dubious feature, but at
		; the moment the opcodes tables use it.  It is either the C
		; type as a string (e.g. "int") or #f for non-portable modes
		; (??? could use other typedefs for #f, e.g. int64 for DI).
		; Use of GCC can't be assumed though.
		non-mode-c-type

		; PRINTF-TYPE is the %<letter> arg to printf-like functions,
		; however we define our own extensions for non-portable modes.
		; Values not understood by printf aren't intended to be used
		; with printf.
		;
		; Possible values:
		; %x - as always
		; %D - DI mode
		; %f - SF,DF modes
		; %F - XF,TF modes
		printf-type

		; SEM-MODE is the mode to use for semantic operations.
		; Unsigned modes are not part of the semantic language proper,
		; but they can be used in hardware descriptions.  This maps
		; unusable -> usable modes.  It is #f if the mode is usable by
		; itself.  This prevents circular data structures and makes it
		; easy to define since the object doesn't exist before it's
		; defined.
		; ??? May wish to later remove SEM-MODE (e.g. mips signed add
		; is different than mips unsigned add).  However for now it keeps
		; things simpler, and prevents being wildly dissimilar from
		; GCC-RTL.  And the mips case needn't be handled with different
		; adds anyway.

		; PTR-TO, if non-#f, is the mode being pointed to.

		; HOST? is non-#f if the mode is a portable int for hosts,
