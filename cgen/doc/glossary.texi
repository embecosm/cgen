@table @asis
@item arch
This is the overall architecture.  It is the same as BFD's use of
@emph{arch}.

@item isa
Acronym for Instruction Set Architecture.

@item mach
This is a variant of the architecture, short for machine. It is
essentially the same as BFD's use of @emph{mach}.

@item CPU family
A group of related mach's.  Simulator support is organized along ``CPU
family'' lines to keep related mach's together under one roof to
simplify things.  The organization is semi-arbitrary and is up to the
programmer.

@item model
An implementation of a mach.  It is essentially akin to the argument
to @code{-mtune=} in SPARC GCC (and other GCC ports).
