@node Simulation
@chapter Simulation support
@cindex Simulation support

Simulator support comes in the form of machine generated the decoder/executer
as well as the structure that records CPU state information (ie. registers).

There are 3 architecture-wide generated files:

@table @file
@item arch.h
Definitions and declarations common to the entire architecture.
@item arch.c
Tables and code common to the entire architecture, but which can't be
put in the common area.
@item cpuall.h
Pseudo base classes of various structures.
@end table

Each ``CPU family'' has its own set of the following files:

@table @file
@item cpu.h
Definitions and declarations specific to a particular CPU family.
@item cpu.c
Tables and code specific to a particular CPU family.
@item decode.h
Decoder definitions and declarations.
@item decode.c
Decoder tables and code.
@item model.c
Tables and code for each model in the CPU family.
@item semantics.c
Code to perform each instruction.
@item sem-switch.c
Same as @file{semantics.c} but as one giant @code{switch} statement.
@end table

A ``CPU family'' is an artificial creation to sort architecture variants
along whatever lines seem useful.  Additional hand-written files must be
provided.  @xref{Porting}, for details.
