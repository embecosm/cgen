; Bit ranges.
; ??? Perhaps this should live in a different source file, but for now
; it's here.
;
; Endianness is not recorded with the bitrange.
; Values are operated on a "word" at a time.
; This is to handle bi-endian systems: we don't want two copies of
; every bitrange.
;
; Instruction word sizes are based on the "base insn length" which is the
; number of bytes the cpu first looks at to decode an insn.  In cases where
; the total length is longer than the base insn length, the word length
; for the rest of the insn is the base insn length replicated as many times
; as necessary.  The trailing part [last few bytes] of the insn may not fill
; the entire word, in which case the numbering is adjusted for it.
; ??? Might need to have an insn-base-length and an insn-word-length.
;
; Instructions that have words of one endianness and sub-words of a different
; endianness are handled at a higher level.
;
; Bit numbering examples:
; [each byte is represented MSB to LSB, low address to high address]
;
; lsb0? = #f
; insn-word-length = 2
; endian = little
; | 8 ... 15 | 0 ... 7 | 24 ... 31 | 16 ... 23 | 40 ... 47 | 32 ... 39 |
;
; lsb0? = #t
; insn-word-length = 2
; endian = little
; [note that this is the little endian canonical form (*)
;  - word length is irrelevant]
; | 7 ... 0 | 15 ... 8 | 23 ... 16 | 31 ... 24 | 39 ... 32 | 47 ... 40 |
;
; lsb0? = #f
; insn-word-length = 2
; endian = big
; [note that this is the big endian canonical form (*)
;  - word length is irrelevant]
; | 0 ... 7 | 8 ... 15 | 16 ... 23 | 24 ... 31 | 32 ... 39 | 40 ... 47 |
;
; lsb0? = #t
; insn-word-length = 2
; endian = big
; | 15 ... 8 | 7 ... 0 | 31 ... 24 | 23 ... 16 | 47 ... 40 | 39 ... 32 |
;
; (*) NOTE: This canonical form should not be confused with what might be
; called the canonical form when writing .cpu ifield descriptions: lsb0? = #f.
; The ifield canonical form is lsb0? = #f because the starting bit number of
; ifields is defined to be the MSB.
; ---
; At the bitrange level, insns with different sized words is supported.
; This is because each <bitrange> contains the specs of the word it resides in.
; For example a 48 bit insn with a 16 bit opcode and a 32 bit immediate value
; might [but not necessarily] consist of one 16 bit "word" and one 32 bit
; "word".
;
; Examples:
;
; lsb0? = #f
; insn-word-length = 2, 4
; endian = little
; | 8 ... 15 | 0 ... 7 | 40 ... 47 | 32 ... 39 | 24 ... 31 | 16 ... 23 |

; lsb0? = #t
; insn-word-length = 2, 4
