; Generating C from RTL
; ---------------------
; The main way to generate C code from an RTL expression is:
;
; (rtl-c mode '(func mode ...) nil)
;
; E.g.
; (rtl-c DFLT '(add SI (const SI 1) (const SI 2)) nil)
; -->
; "ADDSI (1, 2)"
; Mode `DFLT' (DEFAULTmode) means "use the default/natural mode".
;
; The expression is in source form or may be already compiled (with
; rtx-compile).
;
; The `set' rtx needs to be handled a little carefully.
; Both the dest and src are processed first, and then code to perform the
; assignment is computed.  However, the dest may require more than a simple
; C assignment.  Therefore set dests are converted to the specified object
; (e.g. a hardware operand) and then a message is sent to this object to
; perform the actual code generation.
;
; All interesting operands (e.g. regs, mem) are `operand' objects.
; The following messages must be supported by operand objects.
; - get-mode      - return mode of operand
; - cxmake-get    - return <c-expr> object containing operand's value
; - gen-set-quiet - return string of C code to set operand's value (no tracing)
; - gen-set-trace - return string of C code to set operand's value
;
; Instruction fields are refered to by name.
; (estate-owner estate) must be an instruction that has the field.
; Instruction ifields must have these methods:
; - get-mode
; - cxmake-get
;
; Conventions used in this file:
; - see rtl.scm

; This is a fully translated expression (i.e. C code).
