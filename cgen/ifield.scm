; FIXME: Move start, word-offset, word-length into the instruction format?
; - would require proper ordering of fields in insns, but that's ok.
;   (??? though the sparc64 description shows a case where its useful to
;   not have to worry about instruction ordering - different versions of an
;   insn take different fields and these fields are passed via a macro)
;
; ??? One could treat all ifields as being unsigned.  They could be thought of
; as indices into a table of values, be they signed, unsigned, floating point,
; whatever.  Just an idea.
;
; ??? Split into two?  One for definition, and one for value.

; Parse an ifield definition.
; This is the main routine for building an ifield object from a
; description in the .cpu file.
; All arguments are in raw (non-evaluated) form.
; The result is the parsed object or #f if object isn't for selected mach(s).
;
; Two forms of specification are supported, loosely defined as the RISC way
; and the CISC way.  The reason for the distinction is to simplify ifield
; specification of RISC-like cpus.
; Note that VLIW's are another way.  These are handled like the RISC way, with
; the possible addition of instruction framing (which is, surprise surprise,
; wip).
;
; RISC:
; WORD-OFFSET and WORD-LENGTH are #f.  Insns are assumed to be N copies of
; (isa-default-insn-word-bitsize).  WORD-OFFSET is computed from START.
; START is the offset in bits from the start of the insn.
; FLENGTH is the length of the field in bits.
;
; CISC:
; WORD-OFFSET is the offset in bits from the start to the first byte of the
; word containing the ifield.
; WORD-LENGTH is the length in bits of the word containing the ifield.
; START is the starting bit number in the word.  Bit numbering is taken from
; (current-arch-insn-lsb0?).
; FLENGTH is the length in bits of the ifield.  It is named that way to avoid
; collision with the proc named `length'.
