; When Guile has an official object implementation that is stable, things will
; be switched over then.  Until such time, there's no point in getting hyper
; (although doing so is certainly fun, but only to a point).
; If the Guile team decides there won't be any official object system
; (which isn't unreasonable) then we'll pick the final object system then.
; Until such time, there are better things to do than trying to build a
; better object system.  If this is important enough to you, help the Guile
; team finish the module(/object?) system.
;
; Classes look like:
;
; #(class-tag
;   class-name
;   parent-name-list
;   elm-alist
;   method-alist
;   full-elm-initial-list
;   full-method-alist ; ??? not currently used
;   class-descriptor)
;
; PARENT-NAME-LIST is a list of the names of parent classes (the inheritance
; tree).
;
; ELM-ALIST is an alist of (symbol private? vector-index . initial-value)
; for this class only.
; Values can be looked up by name, via elm-make-[gs]etter routines, or
; methods can use elm-get/set! for speed.
; Various Lisp (or Lisp-like) OOP systems (e.g. CLOS, Dylan) call these
; "slots".  Maybe for consistency "slot" would be a better name.  Some might
; confuse that with intentions at directions.  Given that something better
; will eventually happen, being deliberately different is useful.
;
; METHOD-ALIST is an alist of (symbol . (virtual? . procedure)) for this
; class only.
;
; FULL-ELM-INITIAL-LIST is the elements of the flattened inheritance tree.
; Initially it is #f meaning it hasn't been computed yet.
; It is computed when the class is first instantiated.  During development,
; it can be reset to #f after some module has been reloaded (requires all
; object instantiation happens later of course).
;
; FULL-METHOD-ALIST is an alist of the methods of the flattened inheritance
; tree.  Each element is (symbol . (parent-list-entry . method)).
; Initially it is #f meaning it hasn't been computed yet.
; It is computed when the class is first instantiated.  During development,
; it can be reset to #f after some module has been reloaded (requires all
; object instantiation happens later of course).
;
; CLASS-DESCRIPTOR is the processed form of parent-name-list.
; There is an entry for the class and one for each parent (recursively):
; (class mi? (base-offset . delta) child-backpointer (parent1-entry) ...).
; mi? is #t if the class or any parent class has multiple inheritance.
; This is used by the element access routines.
; base-offset is the offset in the element vector of the baseclass (or first
; baseclass in the mi case).
; delta is the offset from base-offset of the class's own elements
; (as opposed to elements in any parent class).
; child-backpointer is #f in the top level object.
; ??? child->subclass, parent->superclass?
; Initially the class-descriptor is #f meaning it hasn't been computed yet.
; It is computed when the class is first instantiated.  During development,
; it can be reset to #f after some module has been reloaded (requires all
; object instantiation to happen later of course).
;
; An object is a vector of 2 elements: #(object-elements class-descriptor).
; ??? Things would be simpler if objects were a pair but that makes eval'ing
; them trickier.  Vectors are nice in that they're self-evaluating, though
; due to the self-referencing, which Guile 1.2 can't handle, apps have to
; be careful.
; ??? We could use smobs/records/whatever but the difference isn't big enough
; for me to care at this point in time.
;
; `object-elements' looks like:
;
; #(object-tag
;   class
;   element1
;   element2
;   ...)
;
; CLASS is the class the object is an instance of.
;
; User visible procs:
;
; (class-make name parents elements methods) -> class
;
; Create a class.  The result is then passed back by procedures requiring
; a class argument.  Note however that PARENTS is a list of class names,
; not the class data type.  This allows reloading the definition of a
; parent class without having to reload any subclasses.  To implement this
; classes are recorded internally, and `object-init!' must be called if any
; class has been redefined.
;
; (class-list) -> list of all defined classes
;
; (class-name class) -> name of CLASS
;
; (class-lookup class-name) -> class
;
; (class-instance? class object) -> #t if OBJECT is an instance of CLASS
;
; (object-class object) -> class of OBJECT
;
; (object-class-name object) -> class name of OBJECT
;
; (send object method-name . args) -> result of invoking METHOD-NAME
;
; (send-next object method-name . args) -> result of invoking next METHOD-NAME
;
; (new class) -> instantiate CLASS
;
; The object is initialized with values specified when CLASS
; (and its parent classes) was defined.
;
; (vmake class . args) -> instantiate class and initialize it with 'vmake!
;
; This is shorthand for (send (new class) 'vmake! args).
; ARGS is a list of option names and arguments (a la CLOS).
; ??? Not implemented yet.
;
; (method-vmake! object . args) -> modify OBJECT from ARGS
;
; This is the standard 'vmake! method, available for use by user-written
; 'vmake! methods.
; ??? Not implemented yet.
;
; (make class . args) -> instantiate CLASS and initialize it with 'make!
;
; This is shorthand for (send (new class) 'make! arg1 ...).
; This is a positional form of `new'.
;
; (method-make-make! class elm1-name elm2-name ...) -> unspecified
;
; Create a 'make! method that sets the specified elements.
;
; (object-copy object) -> copy of OBJ
;
; ??? Whether to discard the parent or keep it and retain specialization
; is undecided.
;
; (object-copy-top object) -> copy of OBJECT with spec'n discarded
;
; (object-parent object parent-path) -> parent object in OBJECT via PARENT-PATH
;
; (class? foo) -> return #t if FOO is a class
;
; (object? foo) -> return #t if FOO is an object
;
; (method-make! class name lambda) -> unspecified
;
; Add method NAME to CLASS.
;
; (method-make-virtual! class name lambda) -> unspecified
;
; Add virtual method NAME to CLASS.
;
; (method-make-forward! class elm-name methods) -> unspecified
;
; Add METHODS to CLASS that pass the "message" onto the object in element
; ELM-NAME.
;                                 
; (method-make-virtual-forward! class elm-name methods) -> unspecified
;
; Add virtual METHODS to CLASS that pass the "message" onto the object in
; element ELM-NAME.
;
; (elm-get object elm-name) -> value of element ELM-NAME in OBJ
;
; Can only be used in methods.
;
; (elm-set! object elm-name new-value) -> unspecified
;
; Set element ELM-NAME in OBJECT to NEW-VALUE.
; Can only be used in methods.
;
; (elm-make-getter class elm-name) -> lambda
;
; Return lambda to get the value of ELM-NAME in CLASS.
;
; (elm-make-setter class elm-name) -> lambda
;
; Return lambda to set the value of ELM-NAME in CLASS.
;
; Conventions used in this file:
; - procs/vars internal to this file are prefixed with "-"
;   [Of course this could all be put in a module; later if ever since
;   once Guile has its own official object system we'll convert.  Note that
;   it currently does not.]
; - except for a few exceptions, public procs begin with one of
;   class-, object-, elm-, method-.
;   The exceptions are make, new, parent, send.
